Open Source Threat Intelligence Feed Tacking Sheet

Please find a collate list of the common Open Soruce Threat Intel feeds in the attached Google Sheet.  This list has been collated from a number of sources and aims to help explain to audit teams, when they ask  what we all look at and why? 
The intention is for us to be able to point to this list as a collated pool used by Threat Intelligence teams from a number of the leading Banks and financial service providers.
